#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
float km;   //Make a variable as miles
float miles;

cout << "Enter a km";
cin >> km;   //Reads in the number the user entered and stores it in km

miles = 0.621371* km;
cout << miles << " miles";   //print(miles, "miles")

return 0;
}

//'cin' is for input to the program
//'cout' is output from the program

//This program is to print "I love CUNY" 9 times in C++.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
int i;   //The index variable for the loop

for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)   //The variable i first takes on the value 0, and the loop will repeat 9 times
	{
	cout << "I love CUNY\n";   //'cout' doesn't put output on a newline, so we need to include the new line character ("\n") at the end of the line
	}
	return 0;
